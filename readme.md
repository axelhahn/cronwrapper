## Introduction

Default Unix and linux cronjobs are quite basic stuff. Mostly you create
"simple, stupid" jobs without output ... that just run. Or should.

If you use a cronjob you need to hide the output otherwise the root user gets an 
email. So if you generate the output and have many cronjobs then you need a 
convention how to name your log files.

Questions:

* How do you check if a job was successful? Just trust them? Watching each log? On each of your systems?
* How do you detect if the last job execution was successful but does not run anymore?

My simple approach: 

By just adding a wrapper in front of your current command 
breaks tons of limits! Suddenly a simple action opens so many possibilities.
