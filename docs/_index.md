## Introduction

Default Unix and linux cronjobs are quite basic stuff. Mostly you create
"simple, stupid" jobs without output ... that just run. Or should.

If you use a cronjob you need to hide the output otherwise the root user gets an 
email. So if you generate the output and have many cronjobs then you need a 
convention how to name your log files.

Questions:

* How do you check if a job was successful? Just trust them? Watching each log? On each of your systems?
* How do you detect if the last job execution was successful but does not run anymore?

My simple approach: 

By just adding a wrapper in front of your current command 
breaks tons of limits! Suddenly a simple action opens so many possibilities.

This repository contains scripts and helpers for local cronjobs

* cronwrapper.sh - a wrapper script to call cronjob scripts
* inc_cronfunctions.sh - an include file that can be sourced in your bash scripts
* cronstatus.sh - ist shows status of all local cronjobs (and use cronwrapper.sh)
* cronlog-sync.sh - syncs logfiles to a central log server

To sync logfiles to a central log server there is script that detects new files in the logdir since the last sync.

## Requirements

Linux system with installed Bash.
Tested on CentOS, Debian, Manjaro, Ubuntu.

## New in 2.0

* ADDED: hooks - execute your own script before and after each cronjob
* ADDED: Support for `NO_COLOR=1`
* ADDED: emoji support (only if NO_COLOR is not 1 and is supported)
* UPDATE: enhanced output for `cronstatus.sh`: show a table with last executions
* UPDATE: renamed variables with prefix "CW_" (for cron wrapper)
* UPDATE: keep stats of returncodes and execution time for custom time (before: 4 days [fixed]; now: 14 days [can be configured with CW_KEEPDAYS])
* UPDATE: cronstatus.sh shows history of returncodes and execution times (max. 10) per job

### Upgrade guide from former versions

* Update your *cronwrapper.cfg* ... 
  * add the prefix "CW_" for existing vars which are now
    * CW_LOGDIR
    * CW_SINGLEJOB
    * CW_TOUCHFILE
  * optional: add variables
    * CW_KEEPDAYS=N where N ist the number of days to keep history of returncodes and execution time; default is 14 (days)
    * CW_HOOKDIR 

(or copy cronwrapper.cfg.dist to cronwrapper.cfg an update the values)
